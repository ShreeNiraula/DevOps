DevOps is a software development approach that emphasizes collaboration and communication between development and operations teams to improve the speed and quality of software delivery. Docker is a popular tool used in DevOps to create, deploy, and manage applications in containers. Containers provide a lightweight and portable way to package and run applications, making it easier to deploy and scale software across different environments. CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) is an integral part of DevOps that focuses on automating the software delivery process. By using Docker and CI/CD tools, teams can streamline the development process, ensure consistent testing and deployment, and reduce the time it takes to deliver software to production.
