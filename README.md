A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including code, libraries, and system tools. Docker images are created from a base image and then modified using a Dockerfile, which specifies the configuration and dependencies required for the software to run correctly in the container. Docker images can be stored and shared through a Docker registry, such as Docker Hub, allowing developers to easily distribute and deploy their applications across different environments. When a Docker image is run, it creates a container, which is an isolated environment that runs the application and its dependencies, making it easy to deploy and manage software across different platforms and environments.
